# Improved support for UAV-based computer vision applications in Search and Rescue operations via RAN Intelligent Controllers
Search and Rescue (SAR) operations can take significant advantage through the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and communication systems. In this article, we explored the functionalities of RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs) for managing and orchestrating network components aimed at critical mission operations assisted by UAVs. For example, UAVs are used to fly over an area where the victim is believed to be located, collect high-resolution video information and transmit it back to a ground base station. The proposed architecture exploits the components of the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) standard specification. Another contribution of this
article is an assessment of a highly complex use case that explores new market trends, such as SAR operations assisted by UAV-based computer vision. The experimental results indicate, for instance, the proposed architecture can substantially improve the performance of applications with sensible Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), through a cognitive loop, able to act on the elements of the communication infrastructure to improve support for critical missions operations assisted by UAV.
